Ideas for LCD display:

*   Teensy3.5 sending/receiving data back and forth to ESP32 wifi display

Substantial noise from J4 (smaller stepper driver) causing skips in encoder pulse responses

*   Root cause: noise from stepper lines causing interference in encoder wires. Routed stepper lines farther away from encoders and shielded them with metal fiber sleeving to reduce noise - works fine now!

Brief foray into building the CanBot: a tri-omniwheel autonomous table that can support 80+ lbs of payload. I've been modifying the firmware, controller, and stub sim to operate on only 3 joints, so that it can be reused between arm and wheeled applications. Since coordinated motion also comes with less constraints on a wheeled robot, I can test trajectory matching on the canbot before "graduating" to the AR3.

Had a code review with Garret. Here are some takeaways:

* For PID control of position and velocity, consider that centering on velocity gives P=velocity, I=position, D=acceleration. Using P factors for each of these values produces a similar result to PID tuning with velocity+position as a target.
* I should build a visualizer of a single axis' rotation and fit to verify that my PID tuning is working without any problems. This will likely be an extension of the current web interface.

Once I've managed to get the firmware running on the canbot, the next steps will be adding bump sensor "limit switches" around it and looking into a simple line-following control scheme. Hmm, maybe I should call it the tribot instead...

Installed an e-stop, after the AC-DC converter to minimize time where the motors are energized. Plus I don't have to cut the PSU cable to inline a switch.

Tried running the jetson for the main host, but it's been having issues where plugging in the USB causes the SD card to unmount. `/bin/ls` not found... not fun.

So I installed raspbian on a pi3 B+ laying around....

* changed the hostname to `ar3`
* installed the [teensy udev rules](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/00-teensy.rules)
* cloned the l2_makerspace repo
* [installed platformio](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html#installation-methods)

and finally, ran `pio run -e teensy35` to build the firmware.

Needed to update the firmware to compile for teensy35 - but now it builds on the pi!

To start the viewer:

```
docker exec -it ar3sim /bin/bash -c 'cd $WEBOTS_HOME/resources/web/streaming_viewer && python3 -m http.server'
```

Running the example via `ar3/webots_sim_launch.sh`, then opening `localhost:8000` for the web controls - can move the arm joints! This totally ignores the simulation server stuff, which would still be neat to have as a capability. But this gets us even closer to a real test.

Trying out webots simulation servers

[http://l2:1999/monitor](http://l2:1999/monitor) - monitors connected sim severs (this is the session server?)

[http://l2:2000/monitor](http://l2:2000/monitor) - monitors the simulation including some fancy grahping

[http://l2:1999/session](http://l2:1999/session) - the address of the least loaded sim server

Have to edit and replace the `localhost` with `l2` in config/setup at `$WEBOTS_HOME/resources/web/server/config/session/default.json`

Unfortunately the use of `ros-foxy-webots-ros2` apt package in post-sim image hasn't been built since early 2020... and there's lots of neat stuff since then. Need to update this image to specifically pull the latest webots image  [R2021a](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases) then [builda nd install webots_ros2](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/wiki/Build-and-Install)

Made lots of fixes in the motion control firmware - a lot of silly mistakes made in variable naming. Switching to floating point also helps a lot (the Teensy has an FPU, so this should be reasonably performant).

Stub robot environment was crashing for some reason


## 2021-04-02

Added websocket reconnect loop and some color indication - would be great to see a real time chart of the position though, for forensics. [https://apexcharts.com/javascript-chart-demos/line-charts/realtime/](https://apexcharts.com/javascript-chart-demos/line-charts/realtime/) would do that.

Maybe a rolling buffer of step details too? For playback / debugging. "Breakpoint" or internal state dump at certain positions?


## 2021-03-30

Back into it! Starting to make it easier to launch the software environment. Going with a script in /ar3 that triggers multiple docker compose files. Not done yet, partial progress in tmux.

Current goal is to have an environment where I can save a file, run a single command, and get a new, running build from scratch in under 5 seconds. Need to:



1. Create script to start the web UI, the firmware sim, and the stub robot environment
2. Add websocket reconnect loop to web UI (refreshes whole page when connection re-established)

Figured out how to get the firmware native execution to terminate - just required actually listening to the SIGINT signal when Ctrl+C pressed, then explicitly exiting the program. Weird that this wasn't done automatically.

After a lot of debugging.... get_steps returned a bool >.&lt;

Can now do the full-sim test setup from 2021-03-12 :D

But encoder limits aren't properly calibrated, and steps aren't converted to angles properly. That's the next step.

Got webots working again via container - it was an issue with Mesa GL version compatibility where the container kept getting OpenGL 3.1 because that was the best it thought it could provide. Using `MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE: 3.3`  appeased webots which had a hard cutoff below that version.

Recovering state on the firmware simulation... it was crashing because the ZMQ REP/RES paradigm wasn't upheld. Changed firmware code to only send if it received, which fixed that.

Test code to drive the firmware is located at `.../ar3/firmware/test/native_client.py`. Changing this to accept keypresses to move each joint, since hand-typing a message is cumbersome.

...but actually, it's impossible to detect "keyup" in a terminal. So building a web app instead, hooray.

Now .../native_client.py opens a web page at port 8000 and communicates via websocket on port 8001. Set "--loopback" to test just the web functionality without having a connected client.

The setup that I'll need to verify:



1. In "sim" folder: `docker-compose run main`, then `ros2 run l2_ar3 node`
    1. Starts simulation environment (no webots). Make sure the container has been built recently (or else use the symlink hack in README.md)
2. In "firmware" folder: `docker-compose run native`
    2. Starts firmware controller
3. In "firmware/test" folder: python3 native_client.py
    3. Starts web control service

Trying to run sim environment via docker (requiring GPU) but with also docker-compose, needed to reinstall docker-compose to get version 1.28.5 for the [new gpu config spec](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gpu-support/).

Looks like two container images in .../ar3/sim: 



*   docker build -t l2moveit -f ./Dockerfile.moveit .
*   docker-compose build

Okay, back to custom controller time. Let's put as little smarts as possible in the teensy, but enough to properly fit position and velocity.

Continuous input and output: [

  Xmask,Y...,...,Cmask

  Xtarget...

  X...

  X'...

]

4*6 values, assume int16 -> 48 bytes/packet, at 115200 baud -> 2400hz, bidirectional -> 1200hz, 0.8ms period theoretical max

Mask passed to teensy includes: stepper enable, stepper compliance(?), limit switch ignore

Mask returned from teensy includes: limit switch made, target reached

Use an LQR controller or PID controller to fit position & velocity from the raspi to the controller.

Then we build a

#### Recovering state

Coming back to this project after a pretty long break setting up the new house. Before the break, I was setting up simulated integration with the robotic arm, the display simulation, and hardware / firmware controller.

To start webots sim:


    docker run --gpus=all --name l2ar3 -it --rm -e DISPLAY -v $(pwd)/webots:/usr/local/webots/resources/projects/ -v $(pwd)/config:/root/.config/Cyberbotics/ -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw -v $(pwd):/volume l2ar3sim /bin/bash


    webots

You can test webots in isolation using the simple_controller.py loaded in that environment

New terminal - exec into the container and run the controller node

	docker exec -it l2ar3 /bin/bash

	ros2 run l2_ar3 node

The sim controller communicates firmware details over zeromq - port 5556 to receive hardware step counts, 5557 to send limit switch state

New terminal - start the display sim


    docker run --gpus=all --name l2display -it --rm -e DISPLAY -v $(pwd):/volume -v


    /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw l2display /bin/bash


    ./run_native.sh

The display looks on websockets port 8001 for data (config at .../display/data/secret.json). You can use the test websocket server to verify behavior in isolation:

	python3 test_ws.py

Note: doesn't seem like I've yet set up websocket-driven data from the webots controller to the display :'(

Re-started a thread with [alex@machinekoder.com](mailto:alex@machinekoder.com) - he uses MachineKit with ROS to drive robotics arms

[https://machinekoder.com/machinekit-ros-open-source-robots/](https://machinekoder.com/machinekit-ros-open-source-robots/) has a good breakdown on forms of hardware control strategy. He recommends installing MachineKit for the HAL and to connect it up with a ros_control node. There's some restrictions on using an RT kernel.

[https://github.com/machinekoder/hal_ros_control](https://github.com/machinekoder/hal_ros_control) is the actual custom code which glues together ros_control and machinekit HAL.
