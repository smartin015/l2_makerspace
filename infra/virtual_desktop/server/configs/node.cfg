# evdev Linux input driver is supported. The default is to use evdev
# on node machines where it is available.
#
# 1: Enabled. Always use X11 keycodes even if evdev is supported.
#
# 0: Disabled. Use evdev if supported or fall back to X11 keycodes.

# Enable or disable logging to the system log file, e.g. syslog
# on UNIX based systems and Events log on Windows platforms.
#
# 1: Enabled. The node will log to the system log file.

#
# Set how often the server has to renew the Kerberos tickets and AFS
# tokens to let users keep their Kerberos credentials inside the
# session. The default value, 600 seconds, makes the server renew
# tickets each 10 minutes. Multiples of 30 are accepted, 30 seconds
# is the minimum value. Value must be lower than the maximum lifetime
# set on the system for Kerberos credentials.

# Set the DS (Differentiated Services) 8-bit field, previously known
# as ToS (Type of Service), at the IP network layer. Valid values are
# numbers from 0 to 255 in decimal or hexadecimal format (0x00-0xff).
# The six most significant bits should be set to the DSCP values recom-
# mended by RFC-2597 and RFC-2598 (e.g. use 72 or 0x48 for DSCP Class
# AF21). The two least significative bits should be set to 0. It is
# also possible to use the obsolete ToS flags (e.g. 16 or 0x10 for the
# LOWDELAY behaviour).

#
# Enable or disable the server to execute single commands through
# D-Bus. This key applies only to Linux platforms.
#
# 1: Enabled. The node will use dbus-launch to run single commands
#    such as gnome-terminal. This is required on those distributions
#    which rely on dbus-launch for standard X session in order to let
#    users run NoMachine custom sessions.
#
# 0: Disabled. Do not use dbus-launch for executing single commands.
#
