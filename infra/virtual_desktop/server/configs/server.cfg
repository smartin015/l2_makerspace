# Set the log level of NX Server. NX Server logs to the syslog all
# the events that are <= to the level specified below, according to
# the following convention:
#
# KERN_ERR         3: Error condition.
# KERN_INFO        6: Informational.
# KERN_DEBUG       7: Debug-level messages.
#
# Note that NX Server uses level 6 in the syslog to log the event.
# This is intended to override settings on the local syslog configur-
# ation that would prevent the event from being actually logged.
#
# The suggested values are:
#
# 6: This is the default value. Only the important events
#    are logged.
#
# 7: Sets logs to level debug.
#
#SessionLogLevel 6

# Point the server to log to a specific file. The default log file is

# /usr/NX/var/log/nxserver.log on Linux.

# SSH:  Redirect port of the SSH server.
#
# HTTP: Redirect port of the HTTP server.
