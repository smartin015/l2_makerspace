# Title

## Purpose

Run a lightweight 3d game environment that allows build and upload to
an Oculus Quest. This environment simulates a virtual makerspace, but is also connected to a physical one.

## Example Steps

Before doing this example, you'll need to build the docker image by running the following command in this directory:

```
docker build --tag l2vr:latest .
```

1. Connect the oculus quest headset to the PC. Make sure USB debugging on the host is enabled (via the headset).
1. Run `./launch.sh` to launch the editor (into test_vr project).
1. Click on the Android icon on the top right of the project window - it will build and run the app on the quest.

**Troubleshooting**

You may additionally need to populate the version templates if this is your first time running (Export Project > Android, click banner at the bottom).

## Future work

Try ImmediateGeometry based streaming of triangle meshes over UDP. Can use [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27521282_3D_Mesh_Compression) as a start when researching compression techniques. This would be useful for streaming and displaying the results of generated/optimized models.

Create a mixed reality whiteboard that can be written on in real life and VR and updates in both.

## Custom modules

Godot allows for custom modules in C++ (see [docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/development/cpp/custom_modules_in_cpp.html)).
The ./modules directory is where custom modules for L2 can live.

You must build them with `scons custom_modules=path/to/modules` for them to be included in the binary.
